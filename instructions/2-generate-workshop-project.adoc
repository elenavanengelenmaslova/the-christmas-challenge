= 2. Generate and configure a workshop project in GitHub

== 2.2 Configure GitHub access to AWS

Configure AWS access keys in GitHub Secrets:

Where `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID` is your AWS Account Id, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY` is your AWS Account Access Key and `AWS_SECRET_KEY` is your AWS Account Secret Key.


NOTE: It is not recommended to use root AWS account for this. If you created a new AWS account when setting up the prerequisites, then follow instructions to secure your account link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-user.html[AWS account root user], then for the workshop use an IAM user with AdministratorAccess permissions.


== 2.3 Test configuration is working

To test GitHub configuration, go to GitHub actions tab and run `Kotlin AWS Christmas Workshop CI/CD` to deploy "Merry Christmas!" AWS Lambda to your AWS account.

When pipeline is green, login to AWS account and go to Lambda Service:
